<p class="about-topic">I have seen a lot of downward curves in many people's life and tried to learn from them as per my own philosophical knowledge and with that I was being hopeful that there won't be any dropping curves in my life in near future as i tried to have myself indulged into doing productive work since last 7 years mainly on android/linux. During these past couple of years i was certain that I would eventually get involved into a nice app/framework developing firm before i pass out of college, but now it seems that it is not likely to be the binary tree i am going to branch out of in my life. I wouldn't blame much to the current recession which seems to be eating out the current jobs among the engineering community cause most of it is of my own causing or just sheer bad luck. Did off-camp interviews but couldn't hit a ctc above 3.5lpa, at this point i wouldn't say depressed but i am truly dissapointed about the current path i would be taking now, I have now started to doubt my programming skills and the knowledge which i have gained throughtout my time as a developer(open) on Android, linux and BSD platforms. I was never distracted or neither i was involved in any un-useful things, I am glad I met some wonderful developer friends and was always involved in programming, I would say being a developer specifically on android kept me away from any un-usual stuffs, but determining a career on it feels like a lost cause to me now. I never loose hope but then i do not believe in wishful thinking, I am blessed to have such wonderful parents with my side that i never feel left out in my life and i feel i can grow out of this situation and try to branch out to different job roles(govt. jobs mainly) than sticking around being a paid software developer. Good life to all. </p>
