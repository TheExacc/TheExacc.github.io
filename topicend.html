<h1> <span class='realname'>Epilogue blog post</span> </h1>

<p class="about-topic"> Last blog for a while, gonna go straight up on this.
these past 2-3 months has had me on knees dealing with stuff , mostly I had to deal with 
stuff which is specific to me, lost some friends, lost motive to refine my skills,
but I have noone to blame instead of myself for my own shit show, but i tried to look for the 
actual issue i was facing which then backtracked to being addicted to watching various medias
and not doing any productive stuff throughout the day and regretting about wasting time during the night.
I wouldn't say it's a me thing and probably some other people out there are also wasting time on watching or consuming
media be it youtube/netflix or even fucking reddit TV. I found keeping myself in a self designed routine helped alot to reduce
down this media consuming addiction (mainly youtube,  netflix/amazom prime). But i had to face the real stuff after that which was
over estimating my skills and knowledge, which limited my knowledge creating a fake scenario that i am above all and I will probably do good in mylife
which is clearly wrong as the actual amount of skill which i currently have is nothing compared to what i really wanna achieve and promised to my parents.
Being on my routine has helped me on this matter but i found cycling my humble nature to overprower this "supremo" feeling helps to minimise this over-estimating thing.
Lastly I was down bad with fixing the procastination issue which is a byproduct of the "over-estimation thing", I was delaying important things 
rather than doing them on time, during school days it was easy to keep it on check as my parents used to scold me if I dont do important things on time,
but now its just not gonna work, this has been a huge setback for me and i feel this will affect me in near future too, but I am still finding an absolute solution to
tackle this issue , for now it seems keeping my self checked with the routine will keep it on check!!.
For the snowflakes among you reading this shitty blog , fucking tackle your issues and growup, I am tryna do the same, peaceout.
