<h1> <span class='realname'>A Shared Memory</span> </h1>

<p class="about-topic">Since i have decided my path i.e., to become an engineer , I have
had a lot of issues , mostly 90 percent of them are because of my poor knowledge and experience
of seeing what life is. I have had made several wrong decisions which have affected me severely
throughout my Btech, most of them directly affecting my life and how i presume the meaning of life.
I had a feeling in me that i need no one and I can live by my own skill and derive everything to my work life
which have made the situation worse for me , Humans are meant to be in a social environment and if we push away the people
we love than it directly affects our brain and our health. But I had these fake feelings that i can make it by my own
and somewhere down the road I forgot life is not about Making it to the top, its about living it while making it to the top
I have been so selfish and naive because of these false feelings that I never looked for love from anyone and pushed others away.
This by far was the biggest mistake I made and it took one of the key important thing from my life , "peace".
I had lost my sleep , I have lost the feeling to do good for others and most importantly i have lost my own self.
I have wasted a lot of time building up fake personalities in me, be it "TheGlitchh" or "TheFallnn" just to focus on my
work life and nothing else , I used to stay awake till 3-4am at dawn even though it wasn't totally necessary.
For the past few days I am trying to reach out to me and trying to find out what I really want from myself.
The answer was, I want to be happy in life in every aspect and in every way possible. So for me its the end
of being fake and now I am trying to be what i really am rather than showing people how tough and alone i can be.
I am glad it wasn't too late for me as I STILL have my friends and family with me, for me its time to be myself i.e.,
  being  "Sourav" and do something good for me and for the world too, "every human being deserves peace and happiness and everyone should
    look for what they really want", Be You , Be unique.
