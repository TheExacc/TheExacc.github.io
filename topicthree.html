<h1> <span class='realname'>Tragedy of TheGlitchh</span> </h1>

<p class="about-topic">Forming of usernames has always been sceptical for a developer that too of an opensource one like me, just like in real life you need to have a philosophy which should drive your very nature of being a developer, but with age the username forms a deep and direct relation to our true nature, I was given the username TheGlitchh during the google plus era, which derives from the famous lepton tauon ( tau ) which has a negative electric spin and has more mass than a regular electron, which translates to me holding a egoistic but stable and powerful characteristics of a developer. On the other hand I was also into all kind of stuff I used to build apps, did kernels, OS and even UI/UX, as i wasn't determined towards a single path I was getting called the glitch guy which then later on formed as TheGlitchh. Now as i was around 18 years old during my peak development days, I almost started to feel that i am getting way to comfortable with being TheGlitchh that i never needed to upskill my social skills in real life, it made me more vulnerable in real life than i initially expected. Everything started to fall apart along with the backlash from the mobile development community (xiaomi) which i was a big part of. But then i always had my skills backing me up and i literally ditched every dev friend of mine and started to base my whole life around me and my skills, which turned out vague and impractical and for that i had to face all the backlash from the dev community all alone which made things worse. I was left with 0 friends and a whole lot of self doubt which then started pilling up and atlast i had to drop the concept of TheGlitchh altogether from every dev part and restructred my dev philosophy basing towards nature and i was then reading a book regarding the concept of engineering and the curious case of binary tree concept, where an engineer observed that a tree is shifting towards right due to availability of a water source and how it uses its root to find the thing it is looking for and then ditch the other part of the roots, which then gave rise to TheFallnn basing upon the philosophy of the autumn or the fall season where the trees learn to embrace the change by sheding off the old dead leaves to grow into a beautiful new tree,if i could sum it up in a one liner it would be "TheFallnn is an concept of accepting the change and learning to grow with it in every aspect of life with time."</p>
