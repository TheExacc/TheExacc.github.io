    <p class="about-topic">Got all the necessary issues in order. Now I can say I have settled well in Hyderabad, Though I dearly 
    miss my family
    it's been a couple of rough weeks going through most of the things mentally, while going through this turmoil of leaving everbody
    thousands of mile away I feel I have stepped into a different section of the questionnaire of life, from here on I won't have my father
    to sit down with me and tell me that everything's going to be okay, it would be my responsibility to fixup my own mess whichever i will be making
    in the near future, though I am paranoid and afraid about the path of life that I am walking right now, but then its the high time for me to 
    step up and learn about the difficulties that life is about to throw at me, But I have always collectively used people's experiences
    to avoid certain dead ends, so far my intellectuality has never disappointed me apart of some speed bumps that i have went through as an experiment.
    But with all that I am still a newbiew..but Engineering has been a great ally to me..the good thing about being a Computer Science Engineer
    is that you get to dwell in the art of logics and wisdoms that each and every semester of it holds, ever since the 2nd year of my Btech
    I have closely monitored each and every aspects of the subjects and applying them in real life to solve issues, binary tree
    has to be my most closest topic of solving issues..being a developer or an enthusiast of CODING since the dark days of 2017
    I have evolved myself to see things a bit differently..evolution of vision and acceptace of mistakes and sufferings has done wonders
    for me..but it can only take me upto this point of life..from here the scenario is different or should I say the sandbox is different
    though I have had a bad habit of giving philosphies a name , be it TheFallnn or TheGlitchh or many others that turned to dust 
    as the evolution of my mind carried on..I feel its a wonderful time for me to not just stick with one philosophy of tau and look a bit inwardly
    hence I have started my quest deeply into the vedas which i feel i can channel to fruity-fy my computer science knowledge.
    The words of my ancestor "Krishna" helped Arjuna to win the greatest and most mightiest war. I hope the vedas and The Bhagvat Gita 
    will also provide an edge to me as I am about to be facing the most cruel war, "The War of Life". As my God Level Developer friend(Sunnyraj) once said
    "at the end what we do is, git commit -f ", guess I will be doing some "git merge" these days, TheGlitchh is not anymore a sentiment, now it's just a username. </p>
