    <p class="about-topic">I am currently at such a point of my life that i could take any decision in my life
    and i tried to take a bizzare decision which almost scraped a good chunk of my self esteem, almost made my parents doubt
    my intellectual knowledge, while stepping into 2023 i simply got a fluke of having a super releveant belief on my luck that 
    whatever i feel i want i can get it, I agree it wasn't mature of me to do such a big mess in my life.
    There is no point of revising anything cause this post is meant for my friends or the people i have lived these past 4 years.
    Everybody was kind to me, but i dont think i was able to be that kind to some people. But life has taught me a lesson now
    that  <span class="realname" > things we want is far off from the things we actually need </span>. And I guess i tried to get a bit greedy with myself on this matter,
    that I got over confident on my nature and my way of life and i had a misconception that i can get anything or anyone(mostly) i want.
    Though that was far away from the reality but then I had mostly failures on this part of my life so I had been a bit greedy or i would say I was being evil.
    But the thing is I have tried well but then i feel i wanted it and not needed it, some people might stay offshore from me for this but then i guess
    I have been questioning my thought process just like they have been questioning my nature now. I took a big step not caring about the words of my wellwishers and in return
    life trashed me back to the ground. Don't know whether this apology is enough(probably not) but to all of my friends and batchmates whoever is reading things
    I am sorry if I've hurted you because of my foolish/reckless nature but I have taken a lesson out of this and I would say all of you are now moved on to a good 
    place and are happy or trying to be happy in your life. These 4 years were really good for me and I am happy that i got you guys as my batchmates
    stay happy and blessed. I have learned from my mistakes and I have grown out of it.   </p>
